# multi-calcs
A place to store, edit, and use saved formulas.

There are still a lot of things I want to do with this.
- Implement brackets and tidy up the calculator.
- Make the user interface an actual GUI instead of using the terminal, and make it more intuitive and professional.
- Add more features like expression simplifying, mathematical constants.
- Also some experimental features like graphing, if I'm motivated.
Help is very much appreciated (I am a self-taught programmer who does stuff mainly for fun, so my code is not optimal, powerful, or pretty).
Bye :3
